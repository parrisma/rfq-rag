# Automating Tedious Tasks with LLMs: RFQ Parsing with RAG

Finance automation has evolved. Pattern matching and traditional NLP are being replaced by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the meaning of written requests, a smart jump beyond just keyword matching. RAG also lets you safely incorporate your company's proprietary and specialised knowledge and can address the critical issue of explainability when using AI with clients. This jump is possible today, using locally or privately hosted models and readily available tools like vector databases.

To demonstrate this, I spent a week building a operational, functional demo that parses structured product requests for quotes. It handles requests in English, French, and Spanish, colloquial language, abbreviations, and typos, for two structured products. The demo reliably extracts the required pricing parameters, provides a full explanation of the LMMâ€™s interpretation and assumptions, and delivers a confidence level for quoting, along with a written request for clarification when needed.
