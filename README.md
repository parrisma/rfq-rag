# Automating Tedious Tasks with LLMs: RFQ Parsing with RAG

**NOTES**
* **All** data, names, products etc in the demo are **totally fictional** and designed & invented **just for illustration**.
* The financial products are only partially defined, with sufficient just to prove they can be differentiated.


Finance automation has evolved. Pattern matching and traditional NLP are being replaced by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the meaning of written requests. The smart jump to RAG lets you safely incorporate proprietary and specialised knowledge in AI workflows and can help address the critical issue of explainability. This jump is possible today, using locally or privately hosted models and readily available and opensource tools like vector databases.

This functional demo parses structured product requests for quotes. It handles requests in English, French, and Spanish, colloquial language, abbreviations, and typos, for two structured products. It can reliably extract the required pricing parameters, provide a full explanation of the LMMâ€™s interpretation and assumptions, and deliver a confidence level for quoting, along with a written request for clarification when needed.
